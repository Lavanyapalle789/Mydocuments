✅ Q1: What is ASPICE and why is it important in automotive?

Answer:
ASPICE is a process assessment model used to evaluate and improve software development processes in automotive. 
It ensures compliance with industry standards, safety (e.g., ISO 26262), and quality.
It helps in producing reliable and maintainable embedded software, reducing defects, and ensuring OEM requirements are met.

✅ Q2: What is the role of SYS.4 in the development process?

Answer:
SYS.4 defines the system architecture. It decomposes the system into manageable subsystems, allocates system requirements to these elements, and defines interfaces between them. This ensures a clear design foundation before moving to integration or implementation.

✅ Q3: How does SYS.5 differ from SYS.4?

Answer:
SYS.4 is about designing the system architecture, while SYS.5 focuses on integrating the system components and verifying that the integration meets architectural and interface specifications. SYS.4 is design-focused; SYS.5 is test- and integration-focused.

✅ Q4: What kind of work products are generated in SYS.4 and SYS.5?

Answer:

SYS.4:

System Architecture Document

Interface Control Documents (ICD)

Requirement Allocation Matrix

SYS.5:

Integration Test Plans

Integration Test Cases and Reports

Integration Logs

✅ Q5: What tools or methods have you used to support SYS.4 or SYS.5 processes?

Answer (example):
I’ve used tools like IBM Rhapsody for system architecture modeling (SYS.4) and Vector CANoe or dSPACE HIL setups for system integration testing (SYS.5). For documentation and traceability, we used IBM DOORS and Polarion ALM.

✅ Q6: How do you ensure traceability in SYS.4?

Answer:
Traceability is maintained by linking system requirements to architectural components and interfaces. Tools like DOORS or Polarion help establish bidirectional traceability from requirements to design and test artifacts.

✅ Q7: What challenges did you face during system integration (SYS.5), and how did you solve them?

Answer:
A common challenge is interface mismatch between software and hardware modules. We addressed it by early interface definition reviews in SYS.4 and mocking/stubbing during integration to isolate modules. We also maintained integration logs for troubleshooting.

1. Knowledge on ASPICE

ASPICE (Automotive SPICE) is a process assessment model to evaluate software development processes in automotive.

Level	Name	Description
0	Incomplete	Process not implemented
1	Performed	Process achieves purpose
2	Managed	Planned and monitored
3	Defined	Standard process across projects
4	Predictable	Measurable and controlled
5	Optimizing	Continuous improvement

Why it's important: It ensures process quality, traceability, compliance (with ISO 26262), and aligns with OEM standards.

2. SYS.4 vs SYS.5
Feature	SYS.4 – System Architectural Design	SYS.5 – System Integration and Testing
Goal	Define system architecture & interfaces	Integrate components and test at system level
Input	SYS.2 (System Requirements)	Architecture from SYS.4, components

3. Knowledge on HIL System

HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulates the vehicle ECU environment by feeding real signals to/from ECUs using simulation models and I/O interfaces.

Components:

Real ECU

Simulation PC

IO Board (e.g., dSPACE, NI)

Signal conditioning units

Rest Bus Simulation

Fault Injection Unit
